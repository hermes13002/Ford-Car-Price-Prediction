Using a three different Model Algorithms:
   Model Algorithms        Accuracy
=====================||================
1. Linear regression ||  72.9950872434692
2. Decison Tree      ||  81.98316938944247
3. XGBoost           ||  89.18162287421569


XGBoost gave the highest accuracy and is used to test a different sample data of which this sample data gets its data form the user's input.
